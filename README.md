Team Semicolon; Problem statement : CR-07
Our problem statement was to produce a solution that produces a Universal assessment platform that supports multiple languages, right-to-left scripts, screen readers, and alternative input methods. Include tools for educators to preview assessments from the perspective of students with varying needs. Educators can create their Assessments without worrying about any accessibility issues. 
As a solution we came up with EqualEdge - where every ability matters . 
our website comes in with features such as:
 * Anvaya - An AI powered voice navigation tool that helps a visually imparied person/student to have control over the websitr accessibility
 * Mitra - An Ai powereed chatbot that supports students in their high and low providing both care and motivation
 * Language Translation- That can translate almost every language known to human into the one the student mmost familar with . It includes both lest to right and right to left written scripts translation
 * find antonym and synonym by simple double click - for cognitively disabled students
 * UI customizer- font-size & style, contrast
 * Biometric Login - for visually imapaired students/ teachers maintaing security and privacy.
 * Real time assessment creation by teachers
 * AI powered asssistants for students to easily access the asssignments
 * Todo Lists for both teachers and students that is real time and voice asssisted
